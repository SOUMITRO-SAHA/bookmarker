# Bookmarker

"Bookmarker" serves as a productivity tool designed to centralize the management of various scattered resources such as articles, documents, videos, tweets, and posts. Users can conveniently synchronize their data between the web and mobile applications. Regardless of where the bookmarks originate, they are accessible through a unified dashboard, allowing for direct access within the dashboard interface.

Moreover, many individuals utilize multiple browsers and wish to bookmark websites across them. However, these bookmarks typically remain isolated within each browser. With this software, users can effortlessly sync bookmarks from multiple browsers into a single dashboard, facilitated by browser extensions.
